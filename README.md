# Adventures in kernel land

I'm just following [The Adventures of OS: Making a RISC-V Operating System using Rust](https://osblog.stephenmarz.com/index.html)

Don't use this repo as a learning source since it will have my notes as I go through the tutorial. Keep in my mind that I'm a beginner.

My notes are a mix of spanish and english. I will also mix information from [OSDev](https://wiki.osdev.org/Getting_Started)
