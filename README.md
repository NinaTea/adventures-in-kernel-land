# Adventures in kernel land

Basicamente estoy leyendo y haciendo lo que[Meyer Zinn tutorial](https://meyerzinn.tech/posts/2023/03/05/running-rust-code-on-risc-v-in-qemu/) escribi√≥.

Don't use this repo as a learning source since it will have my notes as I go through the tutorial. Keep in my mind that I'm a beginner.

My notes are a mix of spanish and english. I will also mix information from [OSDev](https://wiki.osdev.org/Getting_Started)
